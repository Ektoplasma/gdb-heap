# This is a support script for selftest.py

# detects them (and their supporting buffers)

NamedTuple = namedtuple('NamedTuple', ('x', 'y'))

# Ensure that we have a set object that uses an externally allocated
# buffer, so that we can verify that these are detected.  To do this,
# we need a set with more than PySet_MINSIZE members (which is 8):
